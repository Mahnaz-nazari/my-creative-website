      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hi! I'm Mahnaz, an 18-year-old student from Herat.  
        I draw because I love it — it’s a way for me to express my thoughts and feelings.  
        A few months ago, I started studying painting seriously, and I'm learning more every day.
      </p>

      <p>
        But my creativity doesn't stop at drawing.  
        I'm also passionate about computers. I enjoy working with different software, and right now I'm learning programming — starting with HTML, CSS, and Python.  
        I love how code lets me build things and be creative in a whole new way!
      </p>

      <p>
        In addition to that, I’m also an English teacher.  
        I’ve spent years studying the language, and now I help others improve their skills.  
        Teaching helps me grow too — it makes me more confident and connected with people.
      </p>

      <p>
        Art, computers, and teaching are all parts of my creative journey.  
        I believe learning never stops, and I’m excited to keep growing and creating.

      <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
      <p>
        Besides painting and programming, I also enjoy photography.  
        Capturing moments with my camera helps me see beauty in everyday life.  
        I like taking photos of nature, skies, and simple things that tell a story.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also love spending time on detailed drawings — sometimes with pencil, sometimes digital.  
        My drawings often show emotions, culture, and dreams.
